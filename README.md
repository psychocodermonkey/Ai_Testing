# AI Testing playground

This is a simple project to test and experiment with different AI models. Includes a easy method to pull down pre-trained models from Hugging Face.

`.gitignore` is enforced in the `/models/` directory, so you can safely clone models without worrying about them being pushed back to github.

More to come as it gets developed!
